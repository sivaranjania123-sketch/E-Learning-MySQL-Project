# 📊 E-Learning Platform Purchase Analysis (MySQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing purchase data from an e-learning platform using MySQL. The goal is to understand learner behavior, course performance, and revenue trends by working with relational data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a relational database using MySQL
* Perform data exploration using SQL joins
* Apply aggregation and filtering techniques
* Generate insights on learner purchases and course performance

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Language:** SQL
* **Documentation:** MS Word

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The project uses three main tables:

### 1. Learners

* `learner_id` (Primary Key)
* `full_name`
* `country`

### 2. Courses

* `course_id` (Primary Key)
* `course_name`
* `category`
* `unit_price`

### 3. Purchases

* `purchase_id` (Primary Key)
* `learner_id` (Foreign Key)
* `course_id` (Foreign Key)
* `quantity`
* `purchase_date`

---

## 🔗 Data Exploration

Used different types of SQL joins:

* INNER JOIN
* LEFT JOIN
* RIGHT JOIN

These helped combine data across tables to analyze purchase details.

---

## 📊 Key Analytical Queries

* Total spending by each learner
* Top 3 most purchased courses
* Revenue by course category
* Learners purchasing from multiple categories
* Courses with no purchases

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* 📌 **High Revenue Categories:**
  Data Analytics and Programming courses generate the highest revenue.

* 📌 **Top Performing Courses:**
  A small number of courses contribute to most sales.

* 📌 **Learner Behavior:**
  Some learners purchase from multiple categories, showing strong engagement.

* 📌 **Geographical Trends:**
  India has the highest number of learners.

* 📌 **Low Performing Courses:**
  Some courses have little or no purchases.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

* Increase marketing for high-performing categories
* Promote low-performing courses using offers and discounts
* Encourage multi-course purchases through bundles
* Focus on high-performing regions like India
* Improve visibility of less popular courses
